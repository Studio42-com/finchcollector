For the files:
runserver.sh, runserver.bat
makemigrations.sh, makemigrations.bat
migrate.sh, migrate.bat

Note:
Files ending in .sh are for Mac OSX and can be run in the terminal/
and/or the terminal in VSCode. These may also work in the Ubuntu/
Linux/Unix environment.

Files ending in .bat are for Windows and will run from a virtual
session that has had Python and Django installed within it.

Before using on your system, make sure you copy them into the proper
directory. This should be the root level of your Django project
directory. This should be done on a per project basis. The files are
very small. Feel free to edit to suit your needs. You can see these
are very simple and can be edited in any basic text editor.

For .sh files only:

Just to make sure the files work, make them executable using the
following command:

chmod 755 *.sh

(this will modify the permissions on all files ending in .sh)

To launch the file:
./filename.sh
(replace filename with the appropriately named file)

For .bat files, simply type in the name of the file with or 
without the .bat file extension.

(These files may be freely distributed, reused and/or modified as necessary)
